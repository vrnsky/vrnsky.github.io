# Hello, I'm Egor Voronianskii ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a Java developer with over 6 years of experience, primarily working in the exciting world of fintech.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about crafting efficient, robust software solutions. My toolkit includes:

- Java (my primary language)
- Maven
- Spring Boot
- Git
- Software engineering principles

## My Journey

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on various challenging projects in the fintech sector. Each project has been a learning experience, helping me grow both as a developer and a problem-solver.

## Open Source Contributions

I believe in the power of community and open source. I've had the pleasure of contributing to projects like:

- [Blue Pair](https://github.com/aurasphere/blue-pair)
- [Spring Boot Changelog](https://github.com/sepanniemi/spring-boot-changelog)
- [LocalSend](https://github.com/localsend/localsend)
- [Docker KRB5 Server](https://github.com/gcavalcante8808/docker-krb5-server)

These experiences have been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to collaborate with talented developers worldwide and give back to the community that has taught me so much.

## Pet projects
- [StatusHub - Simple uptime monitoring for your business](https://statushub.app?utm_source=https://vrnsky.dev&utm_medium=blog) 

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not immersed in Java code, you can find me:

- Writing articles about Java on Medium and Substack

- Exploring new technologies and best practices in software development

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, tech enthusiasts, or anyone interested in the world of Java and fintech. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat, collaborate, or just geek out about code!

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸš€
