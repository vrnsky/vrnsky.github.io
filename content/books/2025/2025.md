This year, I read the following books:

From this book, I get an overview of how cloud-native projects should look.

### Silo: Dust, Hugh Howey
The last book from the Silo trilogy, enjoyed the whole story.

### The SaaS Playbook, Rob Walling
Found this during some resources related to SaaS. Got a lot of useful information from this book.
