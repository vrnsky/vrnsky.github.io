### Introduction
Picture this: your Java application is handling thousands of requests per second, but your database is struggling to keep up.
Response times are climbing, and your team is debating whether to throw more hardware at the problem.
Sounds familiar? This is where Redis shines. Redis started as a tool for real-time analytics at Twitter (now X).
Now, it’s a versatile caching solution. It manages everything from basic key-value storage to advanced message brokering.

I’ve used Redis in many Java projects over the years. I found that success doesn’t come from adding it to your stack.
It’s about picking the right caching patterns for your needs. In this article, we’ll explore these patterns through practical examples
you can start using today. When you create an e-commerce site for fast product searches or a financial system for reliable data,
you’ll discover useful patterns. These patterns solve real problems.

### Understanding caching fundamentals
Before exploring Redis patterns, it is important to grasp the basic ideas of caching.

#### Cache — aside (lazy loading)
The application first checks that cache for data. If not found (cache miss), it retrieves it from the database, stores it in the cache,
and returns it to the client. This is the most common pattern as it only caches what’s actually needed.

**Real-world example** : E-commerce product catalog
- Scenario: An online store offers millions of products, yet only a small percentage receive frequent views.

**Implementation**: When a customer views a product, the system:

- Check Redis for product details.
- If not found, it fetches from the database and caches in Redis.
- Subsequent customers viewing the same product get faster response times.

**Benefits**: Efficient use of cache space, as only frequently viewed products are cached.
**Used by**: Amazon, eBay for product listing pages

#### Write — through
The system writes data to both the cache and the database in the same transaction. This ensures cache consistency but adds write latency.

**Real-world example** : banking transaction system
**Scenario**: A bank’s account balance tracking system where accuracy is critical.

**Implementation**:

- Updates both the Redis cache and the database in a single transaction.
- Either both succeed or both fail (maintaining consistency).
- We guarantee that all balance reads are accurate.

**Benefits**: No risk of showing an incorrect balance to customers.
**Used by**: Financial institutions and payment processing systems.

#### Write-behind (Write-back)
The system first writes data to the cache. Then, it updates the database without needing simultaneous processing.
This improves write performance but risks data loss if the cache fails before persisting to the database.

**Real-world example**: Social media post likes counter.
**Scenario**: Instagram/Facebook-style application handling millions of likes per minute.

**Implementation**:

- Immediately updates the likes count in Redis.
- Update the database in batches without synchronizing.
- Users see feedback right away while the system manages a high write load effectively.

**Benefits**: Can handle viral posts with a sudden spike in likes.
**Used by**: Social media platforms, gaming leaderboards

#### Refresh-ahead
The cache automatically refreshes data before it expires. This pattern is useful for frequently accessed data but can waste
resources refresing unused items.

**Real — world example**: Weather forecasting application

**Scenario**: Weather app serving current conditions for major cities

**Implementation**:
- System predicts high — traffic periods (morning commute times).
- Proactively refreshes weather data 5–10 minutes before peak usage.
- Ensure fresh data without causing user delays.

**Benefits**: Consistent response times during high — traffic periods.
**Used by**: Weather services, sports scores applications during game times
