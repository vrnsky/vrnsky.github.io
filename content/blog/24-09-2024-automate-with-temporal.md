### Introduction
Today the world is a fast-paced business environment, and automating processes
is crucial for staying competitive. Temporal.io, a powerful open — source platform,
simplifies the development, of scalable workflow automation.
Temporal.io enables developers to create efficient, resilient
business process automation not only with Java but with a wide — range
of different programming languages. In this article, we will explore
how to leverage Temporal.io and Java to streamline your operations.

### Review of existing tools
There are plenty of tools on the market for automating business processes,
such as Camunda, and Zeebe. All these platforms offer workflow automation
capabilities, meanwhile, Temporal.io focuses itself on reliability,
scalability, and developer experience. Camunda and Zeebe, for example,
provide BPMN — based modeling and execution, but may require more setup
and infrastructure compared to Temporal.io.

### Workflow
The description from the official documentation:
In the Temporal Java SDK programming model, a Workflow definition
comprises a Workflow interface annotated with `@WorkflowInterface` and a
Workflow implementation that implements the Workflow interface.
So workflow is like a receipt or a set of instructions for complex tasks
that might take a long time to complete. You should think of workflow like planning a trip:
