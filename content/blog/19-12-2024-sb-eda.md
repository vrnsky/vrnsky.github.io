Modern applications face increasingly complex challenges in handling data and interactions
between services. As our systems grow, traditional request-response patterns often become bottlenecks.
This leads to seek more flexible, scalable solutions. This is where event-driven architecture (EDA) comes in.
It offers a powerful way to build resilient microservices.

### Why event-driven architecture?
Think of event architecture like a city's postal system. Instead of calling each other,
services send messages (events) through a central messaging system. This approach enables services
to operate without relying on one another. It's like how different postal offices operate without knowing
each other's internal workings. When one service has something important to share,
it publishes an event, and any interested services can react to it in their own time.

### Why Spring Cloud Stream and Kafka?
Implementing event-driven architecture might seem complex. But, Spring Cloud Stream and Apache
Kafka make it easy. Spring Cloud stream makes it easy to work with message brokers.
It handles most of the complex messaging infrastructure for you. Think of it as your personal
event-handling assistant that knows how to talk to different messaging systems.
Apache Kafka serves as our reliable message broker. It's like a super-efficient postal service. It can handle
millions of messages, never losing one. It delivers them exactly where they need to go. Together,
these technologies create a powerful foundation for building event-driven systems.

### What we'll build
To make this practical, we'll build a real-world example: an order processing system. We'll create two microservices:
An order service that announces when someone place a new order.
A notification service that listens for these announcements and sends notifications.

This example will teach you to: set up these services, manage messages and errors, and ensure your system is ready for production or close to this state. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to build event - driven microservices that can scale with your needs.
Ready to get started? Let's begin by setting our development environment.

### Prerequisites and local development setup
Before diving into the implementation, let's set up our development environment.
We'll need a running Kafka instance, and the best way to get starts is to use Docker Compose for local development.
First lets create a new Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies. Add these to your pom.xml
