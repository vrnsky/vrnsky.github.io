### Introduction
In today's cloud-native world, managing infrastructure by hand is no
longer practical. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as the de facto
standard for managing cloud resources. Terraform has dominated this space with
its domain-specific language. Pulumi takes a different approach, which benefits Java Developers.

### What is Pulumi?
Pulumi is a modern Infrastructure as Code platform. It lets developers use familiar programming languages instead of domain specific one like HCL or YAML. For Java developers, this means using their knowledge of Java, strong typing, and OOP. They must use the whole Java ecosystem to manage cloud infrastructure.

Key advantages of Pulumi for Java Developers:
- Use standard Java l features instead of learning new DSL.
- Leverage compile-time checking to catch errors early.
- Reuse existing Java libraries and design patterns.
- Unit test your infrastructure code with JUnit 5.
- Integrate with your existing Java CI/CD pipelines.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- Pulumi CLI
- AWS CLI

### Implementation
Now let's create a new Pulumi Java project.

```bash
mkdir pulumi-java-demo
cd pulumi-java-demo
pulumi new aws-java
```
